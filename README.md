# Automatic Ice Composition Estimator (AICE)

Python tool based on artificial neural networks intended to analyse infrared absorption spectra from interstellar ices, to derive its composition (in terms of H<sub>2</sub>O, CO, CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>3</sub>OH, NH<sub>3</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub>) and temperature.

This tool is presented in the following scientific paper: https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025A%26A...702A..87M/.

A user guide is planned to be written and uploaded to the repository in the followings months.
